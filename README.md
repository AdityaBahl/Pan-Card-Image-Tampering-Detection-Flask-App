4. **Python**
5. **Flask**

## Getting Started

Step to run application:

1. Create the copy of the project.
2. Open command prompt and change your current path
   to folder where you can find 'app.py' file.
3. Create environment by command given below-
   conda create -name <environment name>
4. Activate environment by command as follows-
   conda activate <environment name>
5. Use command below to install required dependencies-
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Run application by command;
   python app.py
   You will get url copy it and paste in browser.
7. You have sample_data folder where you can get images to test.

## Why PAN card Image Tampering Detection Flask App?

A **_Pancard Image Tampering Detection Flask App_** can be used to detect if a PAN card image has been tampered with. PAN (Permanent Account Number) cards are government-issued identification cards that are used for tax-related purposes in India. Tampering with a PAN card image could be used to commit fraud or other illegal activities, so it's important to be able to detect any tampering that may have occurred. A Flask App can be used to create a user-friendly interface for users to upload and check their PAN card images, making the process of detecting tampering more convenient and accessible.

## Algorithm

1. The game generates a grid of letters and displays it to the player.
2. The player selects a sequence of letters in the grid to form a word.
3. The game sends a request to a dictionary API to check if the word is a valid English word.
4. If the word is valid, the game updates the score and displays a new grid of letters to the player.
5. If the word is not valid, the game informs the player and allows them to try again.

This is just one possible approach to building a Wordle-like game. There are many other ways to design and implement such a game, and the specific algorithms and techniques used will depend on the desired features and functionality of the game.

## Challenges and Limitations

There are several challenges and limitations that may arise when developing a Pancard Image Tampering Detection Flask App:

1. **_Image quality:_** The app must be able to handle images of varying quality, such as those taken with a smartphone camera or those that have been scanned.

2. **_Tampering detection:_** The app must be able to accurately detect tampered images, which can be difficult if the tampering is subtle or not easily visible to the naked eye.

3. **_False positives:_** The app may generate false positives, where it incorrectly identifies an image as tampered even though it is not.

4. **_False negatives:_** The app may generate false negatives, where it fails to identify that an image has been tampered.

5. **_Security:_** The app must be secure, as it will be handling sensitive personal information such as PAN numbers.

6. **_Scalability:_** The app must be able to handle a large number of image uploads and processing at the same time.

7. **_Maintenance:_** The app must be regularly updated to ensure that it is able to detect new forms of tampering and to fix any bugs or issues that may arise.

8. **_Privacy:_** The app must comply with all relevant privacy laws and regulations.

9. **_Limited Data:_** The model will be trained on limited data and therefore the accuracy is limited.

10. **_Limited model performance:_** The model has a limited performance and will not be able to detect all the tampering.

11. **_Limited resources:_** The app may be limited by the resources available, such as computing power and storage.

Overall, it's important to keep in mind that developing a Pancard Image Tampering Detection Flask App is a complex task that requires a variety of skills and knowledge in image processing, machine learning, and web development.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, building a Wordle-like game using APIs and Node.js can be a challenging but rewarding project. By using APIs, the game can access and retrieve data from external sources, providing a rich and dynamic gaming experience for players. Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, can be used to execute the game's code and handle its server-side logic. Some potential challenges that may arise include integrating with external APIs, managing the game state, ensuring good performance, testing and debugging, and maintaining security. By carefully designing and implementing the game, it is possible to create a fun and engaging Wordle-like game that players will enjoy.
